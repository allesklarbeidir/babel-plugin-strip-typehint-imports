# Node Library Boilerplate

Every time I write a new JS library I find myself taking an hour just to set up all the configurations. So this is a boilerplate for myself, that includes:

* Babel 7.0
* Eslint, with the Google config
* Mocha, with nyc for coverage
* Semantic Release and Travis Deploy Once
